# This is a program to create a nested tuple to store roll no name and marks of the students.
# t1 = ((101,"Aman",98),(102,"Geet",95),(103,"Sahil",87),(104,"Pawan",79),(105,"Zara",75))
# print("SNo","Rollno","Name","Marks")
# for i in range (0,len(t1)):
#    print((i+1),'\t',t1[i][0],'\t',t1[i][1],'\t',t1[i][2])        ('\t' This character is used for adding horizontal space.)
# SNo     Rollno   Name   Marks
# 1        101     Aman    98
